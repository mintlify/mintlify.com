  <Accordion title="I am an Accordion in an AccordionGroup.">
    You can even put other components inside Accordions.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="We default to closed accordions." defaultOpen="true">
    But changing the default is as easy as setting the title.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion
    title="We even have icons..."
    description="and descriptions!"
    icon={solid("alien-8bit")}
  >
    Our icons are powered by Font Awesome.
