## The Basics

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with the following metadata syntax with `---` at the start and end:

<CodeGroup>

```md Schema
---
> title: [title of the page]
---
```

```md Example
---
> title: "Page"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

We will use the name of the file if you forget to include a title.

Other metadata goes in between the same `---` lines. For example, this page uses this metadata:

```md This page's metadata
---
> title: "Page Titles and Metadata"
> description: "Metadata is important for API pages and SEO optimization"
---
```

## API Pages

API pages lets you build an interactive API playground. To create an API page, you must set an `api` or `openapi` property in the page metadata.

Learn more about setting up a page for the API playground in [API components](/api-components/overview).

<CodeGroup>

```md Schema
api or openapi: [method] [endpoint]
```

```md API Example
api: "GET /users"
```

```md OpenAPI Example
openapi: "GET /users"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Descriptions

You can show a description that shows directly under the title with the `description` metadata.

## Sidebar Title

You can show a different title in the navigation with the `sidebarTitle` metadata. This is useful if your title is long and you want something shorter in the navigation links.

## Search Engine Optimization

You can set meta tags like the image set when shared on social media by passing them into your page's metadata. Meta tags with colons need to be wrapped in quotes.

```md Example
"twitter:image": "/images/your-photo.jpg"
```
