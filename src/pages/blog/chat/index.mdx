We are excited to announce that **Mintlify Chat** - our AI-powered conversational search for documentation discovery - is now out of private beta. Built with the technology behind <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, Mintlify Chat learns from your documentation to answer any question your users might have.

You might be familiar with the conventional keyword search that offers 10 different suggestions of what you may (or often, may not) be looking for. We saw users struggle to find the solutions they needed - we built Mintlify Chat to reduce that friction and ensure customer success. With a simple and intuitive experience, we can deliver information quickly and effectively.

Eager to see Mintlify Chat in action? Go to <a href="https://mintlify.com/docs" target="_blank">mintlify.com/docs</a>, hit `cmd` + `K`, and ask away.

## How we built Mintlify Chat:

Ever since Mintlify launched (and perhaps since the beginning of documentation), we've been looking for ways to improve information discoverability. While GPT-3.5 had potential, it lacked consistency and quality, being prone to <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/llm-hallucinations-ec831dcd7786" target="_blank">hallucinations</a> and pulling out misleading or entirely false results from thin air.

The only thing worse than providing no answer was providing the incorrect answer—as it was, our search for more effective documentation discovery would have to wait.

<a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a> changed all that. While GPT-3.5 would've scored in the bottom 10% of LSAT test
takers, GPT-4 is scoring in the top 10%. On top of that, our own test runs have seen
a drastic improvement in quality and consistency of answers. With GPT-4, the advancement
of intelligent documentation search and discovery has become a reality.

Powered by GPT-4, Mintlify Chat has been made possible through collaboration with our friends at <a href="https://inkeep.com" target="_blank">Inkeep</a>. With their partnership, building an AI-powered chat system only required a few API requests. From there, our team fine-tuned all aspects of the chat system, from optimizing product performance to overseeing quality control.

The end result? An intelligent search system primed to deliver the best answers for your documentation queries, each and every time.
